[caption id="attachment_1013" align="alignleft" width="500"][![Add/Remove Column Screen of Report Page](http://audgendb.chop.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AnatomyReportAddRemove.png)](http://audgendb.chop.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AnatomyReportAddRemove.png) Add/Remove Column Screen of Report Page (Click Image to Enlarge)[/caption]






### Important Fields On
The Add/Remove Column Screen





	
  * A. Available Columns

	
  * B. Selected Columns

	
  * C. Exit Screen Options










### A. Available Columns


The left hand box titled â€œAvailable Columnsâ€ contains all available columns that can be added.

One can select a data concept to add as a column by either scrolling through all available columns or by searching for the desired data concept using the search box. Similar to the search box on the query page, one can narrow down the choices in real time based on keywords that match the letters typed. Once the user has found the desired data concept, select the â€œ+ Addâ€ button to the right of the concept to add it as a column in the report. Note: After the column has been added, it wonâ€™t appear again in the â€œAvailable Columnsâ€ box.


### B. Selected Columns


The right hand box titled â€œSelected Columnsâ€ holds all columns that the user has selected. The Patient Alias is automatically added to the â€œSelected Columnsâ€ but can be removed by clicking on the black â€œX Removeâ€ in the upper right corner.

Once the desired column has been identified and the "+ Add" button has been clicked, the new column will appear in the "Selected Columns" box. To remove a previously selected data concept from the â€œSelected Columnsâ€ box, click on the â€œX Removeâ€ button to the right of the concept name.


### C. Exit Screen Options


Before returning to the main Report Page the user must select one of the two buttons found in the lower right hand corner of the web page. If the user selects â€œcancelâ€ there will be no change to the Report Page. To add the selected columns to the original Report Page, click on â€œUpdate Columns.â€ Upon selecting this button, the user will be returned to the Report Page.
