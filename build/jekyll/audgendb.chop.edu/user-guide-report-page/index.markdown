[caption id="attachment_989" align="alignleft" width="500"][![Anatomy of a Report](http://audgendb.chop.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AnatomyOfReportAudioPTApage.png)](http://audgendb.chop.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AnatomyOfReportAudioPTApage.png) Graphic demonstrates six major fields on Report Page (Click Image to Enlarge)[/caption]






### Important Fields On A Report Page





	
  1. Rows and Unique Patient Counter

	
  2. Main Report Field

	
  3. Chosen Query Conditions

	
  4. Add/Remove Columns

	
  5. Export to CSV

	
  6. Refine Query










### 1. Rows and Unique Patient Counter


Data in the Report Page is either encounter-level or patient-level. When a report is first generated, a list of patient aliases - a patient-level attribute - are given, and therefore, each row represents a unique patient. As the user adds columns, the data can become encounter-level with multiple rows per patient, each row representing a different encounter.


### 2. Main Report Field


The light gray bars above and below the list in the main report field contain page navigation controls. By clicking on these navigation links, the user can move to a specified page number, go to the next page, go to the previous page, or alter the number of rows displayed per page.

HINT: The data can be sorted as ascending or descending by clicking on the yellow field surrounding the Field Name.


### 3. Chosen Query Conditions


The query conditions used to generate the report are listed in the top center region of the Report Page. To change query conditions please see "Refine Query" below.


### 4. Add/Remove Columns


To add columns to the original report, the user must select the â€œAdd/Remove Columnsâ€¦â€ button in the upper right hand corner of the page. Upon clicking on this button, the [Add or Remove Column screen](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/documentation/user-guide-add-or-remove-column-from-report/) will pop up.


### 5. Export to CSV


In order to download the report to the client computer, select the â€œExport to CSVâ€ button in the upper right hand corner of the Report Page. Data will be exported in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format and can be read by many spreadsheet and statistics programs including Microsoft Excel.


### 6. Refine Query


If at any point the user wishes to tweak the study conditions, click on â€œRefine Conditions,â€ located to the left above the Report Page box. Selecting this text will return the user to the Query Page.
