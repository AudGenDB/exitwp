### 1. Patient Alias/Demographics


The Patient Detail Page gives a snapshot of all data pertaining to a specific patient. The patient alias and demographics are listed on the left hand side of the screen above the upper light grey bar. Use this information to verify that one has selected the correct patient.


### 2. Encounter Category Navigation Bar


The light grey bar under the demographic data enables the user to navigate within the Patient Detail Page. Each populated tab within the grey bar has a number in parenthesis to the right of the data category title. This number represents the number of encounters a patient has had where data for the specified category was collected. Data Categories and subcategories are as follows:

### 3. Patient Synopsis Field


The patient synopsis field gives key information for each patient in an easy-to-read format. The summary window displays information concerning the patientâ€™s genetic findings, hearing aid and cochlear implant status, FM information, and average PTA overtime (to visualize progressive hearing loss). This window is designed to give the user an overview of the patient to determine quickly whether the patient fits the criteria that the user wanted. If not, the user can now go back to the Query page to refine the query conditions.


### 4. Record Added/Updated


The text in the lower grey bar provides users with the dates that patient records were added and last updated.


### 5. Return Location


Navigation buttons located on the left hand side of the screen above the patient detail box enable the user to return to previous pages. To return to the Report Page select â€œBack to Report.â€ If at any point the user wishes to alter the study conditions, click on â€œRefine Conditionsâ€ to return to the Query Page.
