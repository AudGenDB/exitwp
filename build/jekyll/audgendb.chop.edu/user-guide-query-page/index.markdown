## Anatomy of the Query Page






[caption id="attachment_919" align="alignleft" width="500"][![Query Page Showing 5 Boxes Delineating Query Windows Described Below](http://audgendb.chop.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AnatomyQueryPage.png)](http://audgendb.chop.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/AnatomyQueryPage.png) Query Window Showing Five Important Fields for Making Queries (Click Image to Enlarge)[/caption]






### Important Fields On The Query Page





	
  1. Data Categories

	
  2. Drop Down Menu of Query Concepts

	
  3. Search Box for Query Concepts

	
  4. Graphics Tool for Criteria Selection

	
  5. Query Builder










### 1. Data Categories


The tabs located across the top of the field and also shown in the screenshot above group query concepts into larger data categories. Tabs that are active are colored, and lead to the drop-down menu shown as Field 2. The fully implemented application will have data categories that encompass Audiology, Demographics, Genetics, Imaging and Otology.


### 2. Drop Down Menu of Query Concepts


When a data category is selected, a drop down menu will appear as a column on the left-hand side of the page. The drop down menu contains all query concepts associated with the selected category. While all of the options in the drop down are query concepts, some contain only one data field while others draw from multiple data fields to create a more complex query. A more detailed description of the query concepts and data fields can be found in [Data Field Description page](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/documentation/datafields/) of the Documentation.


### 3. Search Box for Query Concepts


Note the Search box in the upper right hand corner of the application. The search box will find a data field or query concept in any data category that matches the keyword entered.

HINT: As the user types into the search box, the application identifies fields with keywords that start with the letters typed in, so that by the time the user types in â€œsenâ€ the â€œHas Sensorineural Lossâ€ category has been identified.


### 4. Graphics Tool for Criteria Selection


When scanning through data concepts one will notice that there are three types of graphics tools used for criteria selection. The following text will describe each graphics tool and how one should use it.


1.Â  X-Y Graph: This graph is typically used for data concepts with more than 10 potential options. One must first define the range. Options include â€œgreater than,â€ â€œequal to,â€ â€œless than,â€ and â€œnot equal to.â€ One can select the range by either entering numbers into the text boxes or by grabbing and selecting an area on the graph itself. When appropriate, X-Y graphs have modifiers such as Masking, No Response etc.


<p


2. Pie Chart: This graph is typically used for data concepts with fewer than 3 options and often contains yes/no/no data answers. When an option has been selected, the chosen portion of the pie chart will turn blue. To unselect an option simply re-click the blue region.




3. Bar Graph: This graph is typically used for data concepts with 3 to 10 potential options. When an option has been selected, the chosen bar in will turn blue. To unselect an option simply re-click the blue bar.


HINT: To add a data concept to a query one must use the â€œ+ Add Conditionâ€ button in the lower right hand corner of the screen. After clicking on the button â€œ+ Add Conditionâ€ will change to read â€œCondition has been Added.â€ If one returns to this data concept and changes the query condition one must click â€œUpdate Queryâ€ in the lower right hand corner to add the new query conditions.


### 5. Query Builder


The â€œConditionsâ€ box located in the upper right hand corner of the screen displays all the selected query conditions. One can remove a query condition by clicking on the â€œXâ€ at the top right corner of each panel.
HINT: To return to a data concept click on the desired panel in the â€œConditionsâ€ box.
When one is done adding query conditions, hit [â€œGet Reportâ€](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/documentation/user-guide-report-page/) to see the results.
