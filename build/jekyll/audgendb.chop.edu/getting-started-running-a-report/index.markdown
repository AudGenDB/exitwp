### 3. How to Generate a Report

**Initial Report Screen.** After selecting "Get Report," a report similar to the one pictured to the right will be generated. To look at a single patient in more depth or to screen a cohort individual by individual, click on the patient alias. This will bring up a full report for each individual patient. Reports contain information on ABR Tests, Procedure History, Speech Recognition, Audiology Results and Radiology Studies.

**Adding Additional Columns of Data to Report.** To add data columns to the report, click on the "Add/Remove Columns" button in the upper right hand corner of the web page. A new page will pop up. To browse available columns scroll down the left hand column or simply type the name of the desired column into the search box. When the user has found the column they wish to add, click on the "+ Add" button located to the right of the desired column name. The column name will now appear under "patient alias" in the right hand column. To remove a previously added column click on the "x Remove" button located to the right of the column name you wish to remove. When all desired columns have been added select "Update Columns" in the lower right hand corner of the screen in order to view an updated report.

**Exporting Report to a Spreadsheet.** Patient lists can be exported and downloaded as a CSV file by clicking on the "Export to CSV" button in the upper right hand corner of the web page. The CSV formatted document containing the information in the report will be generated, and this can be opened by spreadsheet programs, such as Excel, to further analyze the data. The outputted data will reflect that data type that is stored in the database, or alternatively hyperlinks to the data, in cases such as images (i.e. audiograms) or patient report screens for the "patient alias" field.

_Useful Hint:_ The link given for the audiogram image (i.e. [http://audgendb.chop.edu/app/plotting/audiograms/151465/small.png](http://audgendb.chop.edu/app/plotting/audiograms/151465/small.png)) shows a small version of the audiogram appropriate for the reports page, but a bit too small to use comfortably (**Note: the user will need to be logged into the site to access these images**). However, by changing the name of the file to medium.png (i.e. [http://audgendb.chop.edu/app/plotting/audiograms/151465/medium.png](http://audgendb.chop.edu/app/plotting/audiograms/151465/medium.png)), you will get a full-sized audiogram. Furthermore, by changing the file name to large.png, you will be able to access an image with resolution appropriate for publication.
