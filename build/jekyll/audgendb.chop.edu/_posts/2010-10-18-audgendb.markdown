The Audiological and Genetic Database (AudGenDB) is a medical and research data resource that supports qualified researchers studying pediatric hearing health.Â  The database draws information from several sources, including electronic health records, audiological instruments, radiological imagery, clinical genetics results, and genomics research records, and makes them accessible to researchers using a powerful, intuitive, web-based query interface.Â  The goal of AudGenDB is to promote research into the causes of pediatric hearing loss with the long-term aim of developing therapies to ameliorate or cure congenital deafness.
