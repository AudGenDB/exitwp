A webinar was held Wednesday, November 2, 2011 at 10-11:00am EDT (1400-1500 UTC) to provide an introduction to the Audiological and Genetic Database (AudGenDB) web application. One of the project scientists, John Germiller, MD, PhD, provided an introduction to the basic features of AudGenDB, and then demonstrated how it can be used to address several research use cases.

AudGenDB contains data on over 37,000 patients (and growing), including  over 4,000 with sensorineural hearing loss, and over 8,000 with  conductive hearing loss.  Over 1000 MRI and CT studies are available on a  subset of these patients. ï»¿
