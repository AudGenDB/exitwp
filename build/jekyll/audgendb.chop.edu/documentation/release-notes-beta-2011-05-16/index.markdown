### Release Summary




We are excited to release this** first public beta** of AudGenDB to the community! While we know we have a lot of work to do in making this a useful resource for a wide array of researchers, we wanted to make this initial release available as early as possible so you can give us feedback on the data and capabilities. Don't hesitate to [contact us](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/about/contact/) with problems, questions, and ideas. We would love to hear from you.





**Update:** A minor update was released on May 20, 2011, [see the release notes]( http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/documentation/release-notes-may-20-2011/) for details.




### Data Highlights





	
  * Audiologic data from **37,273 individuals** including **55,997 tympanograms**, **57,278 audiograms**, and   **1,086 ABR results** (numerical). Additionally, there are **derived data** elements such as **PTA**, **severity of hearing loss**, and **audiogram shape** available on a per-audiogram basis

	
  * **Basic demographic information** is available for patients

	
  * **CT and MRI images** from** 238 individuals**




## Major Features





	
  * **Visual query builder** with **interactive graphic displays **of the data in the database

	
  * **Customizable reports** with sortable columns

	
  * Reports can include audiogram images, **graphs of PTA over time (for investigating progression)**, and other fields which are not necessarily amenable to query

	
  * **Export to Comma Separated Value **(CSV) for use in Excel and statistics packages

	
  * Reports allow **"drill-down" for detailed data** on individual patients including procedure history, audiometry, imaging, ABR, and speech recognition testing (when available)

	
  * Web browser based **radiology imaging** viewer with **measurements**, **zoom**, and **contrast** controls





## Known Issues





	
  * The representation of Genetics data for Connexin 26 mutations needs to be made more intuitive for query purposes

	
  * There are a very limited number of CT and MRI studies available (more details are forthcoming on the website in a post on privacy and de-identification of records)

	
  * The default display size of audiograms in the user interface may be too small to readily see details for complex cases


  * Legends are not yet available for audiogram symbols


  * There is no way to include/exclude patients based on diagnoses or procedures performed


  * There is no way to save queries or reports for re-use (this feature is planned for a future release, see our detailed [project roadmap](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/about/new-features-scheduled/))




## A Note on Supported Web Browsers
