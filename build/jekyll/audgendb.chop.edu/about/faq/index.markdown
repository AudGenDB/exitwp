#### The data that I need are not included in the AudGenDB database; what can I do?




The AudGenDB resource is being actively developed, and a [schedule for new features and data](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/about/new-features-scheduled/) is available. Â We value any input that the hearing research community has during the development of the database, and encourage you to please [contact us](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/about/contact/) with any suggestions or questions that you may have.





#### Why doesn't the site appear to work correctly (a note on supported web browsers)?




AudGenDB is a modern web application that requires a modern web browser. While we make every effort to support older web browsers, your experience will be substantially better when using the **latest version** of [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/), [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/), [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), or [Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.0](http://www.microsoft.com/IE9)*.





*If you are a Windows XP user, please note that Internet Explorer 8.0 is the maximum version available on Windows XP. While it is supported, your experience will be substantially better using [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/).





#### What are the inclusion criteria for procedures in the AudGenDB database?




These are based on CPT codes that include relevant procedures for hearing impairment, such as those impacting pediatric otology, otolaryngology, audiology, neurosurgery, etc. Â Due to copyright considerations, we are not able to post the codes on the internet. Â If you have specific questions, please [contact us](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/about/contact/).





#### In the report screen, why does the number of rows change when I add or subtract columns in the report?




The number of rows reflects encounter level data, and will change based on the number of encounters in the column that was added or subtracted. Â The number of unique patients will give the researcher a sense of how many individuals are involved. Â At the beginning of every query the number of rows are identical to the number of unique patients, because the "patient alias" is patient-level data.





#### What is the source of the records in the database?




The database draws information from several sources, including electronic health records, audiological instruments, radiological imagery, clinical genetics results, and genomics research records.





#### What quality control procedures have been undertaken to ensure the accuracy of the data in the database?




The vast majority of the information has been drawn from the electronic medical records system at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and therefore, is subject to the types of errors that come with data in a clinical care setting.





#### Is AudGenDB the largest pediatric audiological database?




As of October 2015, to our knowledge, it is.





#### What are the funding source for the AudGenDB project?




The AudGenDB project is led by a team of researchers from the [Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute](http://www.research.chop.edu/), and is [funded](http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=7764646&icde=6046582) by the [National Institutes on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders](http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/) of the [NIH](http://nih.gov/).
