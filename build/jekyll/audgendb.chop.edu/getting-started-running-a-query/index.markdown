### 2. How to Run a Query

**Initial Query Screen.** When the user signs in, the application will open as shown to the left. To browse categories select a tab and scroll through the options in the left-hand column. For a more direct search type the desired category into the search box in the upper right hand corner.

The sample query below will look for patients with sensorineural hearing loss and a pure tone average of greater than or equal to 60 dB in either ear. To execute this query follow the steps listed below.

**Query Condition 1.** Find "Has Sensorineural Loss" by scrolling within the "Audiology" tab or by typing "Sensorineural Hearing Loss" into the search box. Once the user has reached the SNHL category, select "yes" by clicking on the correct portion of the pie chart. To add the condition to a query, click on the "Add Condition" button in the lower right hand corner. The newly added condition will appear in yellow in the "conditions" box in the upper right-hand portion of the screen as show in the screenshot to the right.


_Useful Hint:_ A couple of features to notice during this query: 1) as the user types into the search box, the app identifies fields with keywords that start with the letters typed in, so that by the time the user types in "sen" the "Has Sensorineural Loss" category has been identified. 2) When the cursor hovers over a choice on the graph, the number of records that correspond to that answer are given in a small gray box floating above graph.

**Query Condition 2.** Find "Pure Tone Average (PTA)" by scrolling within the "Audiology" tab or by typing "PTA" into the search box. Once the user has found the PTA category, manually set the criteria to "greater than or equal to" "60" in "either ear" and then add the condition. The "conditions" box will now be updated as shown top the left.

To see the patient list and the full report click on the "Get Report" button located at the bottom of the conditions box.
