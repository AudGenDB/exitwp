AudGenDB serves as a valuable resource to researchers in a multitude of fields. Given the varying degrees of specialty and expertise of the site's users, we have constructed a set of general tutorials to help each user maximize productivity and better understand the applicationâ€™s content. Currently, an academic tutorial is offered in Audiology, andÂ  we plan to write tutorials on Otolaryngology and Genetics.

Additionally, we have written a general tutorial to guide the beginner in the use of the web application to query the database. After completing the tutorial, users will be able to select query conditions, run queries, analyze results, and export data. Please take advantage of the tutorials as you continue to explore AudGenDB.
