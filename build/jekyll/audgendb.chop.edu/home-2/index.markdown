The Audiological and Genetic Database (AudGenDB) is a **medical and research database** resource that **supports qualified researchers studying pediatric hearing health**. The database draws information from several sources, including electronic health records, audiological instruments, radiological imagery, clinical genetics results, and genomics research records, and makes them accessible to researchers using a powerful, intuitive, **web-based query interface**. To get started, [take the brief introductory tutorial](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/about/getting-started-2/) or [jump right in and sign up](https://audgendb.chop.edu/app2/login/).

Currently, the web application for querying the database is in [public beta testing](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/about/new-features-scheduled/), and a phased implementation of several clinical areas of interest are scheduled; audiology and demographics have been [released initially](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/documentation/release-notes-beta-2011-05-16/) followed by [diagnoses and procedures](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/release-notes-july-1-2011/). [New features are scheduled](http://audgendb.chop.edu/index.php/about/new-features-scheduled/) to be added to the web application in the near future.
